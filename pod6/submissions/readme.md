# Workshop Submissions

## Purpose

This folder is designated for the submission of completed practical exercises by other pods after attending this workshop. Each pod is required to complete the assigned exercise and submit their work here.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Each pod must create a folder named after their pod, following this naming convention:  
  `pod-#-submission/`  
  Example: `pod-2-submission/`
  
- Inside their folder, each pod should include:
  - **Completed Exercise**: All files related to the practical exercise from the workshop.
  - **README (optional)**: A brief explanation of the submission, if necessary, including how to run or test the solution.

- **Deliverable**
  - Create a workflow and upload it here!

### Submission Format:

- Ensure that all submission files are clearly labeled and organized.
- Any code submissions should include proper documentation or comments to explain functionality.
- If the submission includes a report or additional documentation, ensure it is provided in PDF format for consistency.

This folder ensures that all submissions are organized and easily accessible for review by the workshop providers.
