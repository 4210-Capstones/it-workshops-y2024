# Documentation

## Workshop Description

This workshop covers a variety of documentation tools and practices. The goal is to provide an in-depth understanding of the importance of having files that clearly document your code, so others can refactor it and follow installation instructions for any program, software, or code. We will demonstrate practical applications such as creating README files, writing commit messages, and using GitHub Pages and Wikis. Additionally, weâ€™ll explore tools like auto-documentation and provide guidance on documenting with Sphinx. Participants will be guided through a live demonstration and hands-on activities to ensure mastery of the subject matter.
