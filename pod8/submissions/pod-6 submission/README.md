## Installation
In order for the program to work, a java development environment should be running on your machine. Once the JDK is installed on your machine, we will need to follow the next simple steps:
1. Create a directory on your machine where you would like the program to exist
1. Download/clone the repository for all the source code from our [GitLab](https://gitlab.cs.uno.edu/example_program)
1. Once all the source code has been downloaded to the directory, simply compile all the files in your terminal or in git bash by typing in `javac *.java` into the terminal.
1. Once the source code has compiled correctly, all you need to do is run the text-based user interface. Do this by typing into your terminal `java ExampleProgram`.
1. All done! See the below section **Usage** for instructions on how to use the program.
